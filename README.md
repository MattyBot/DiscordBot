## About Us

### :sparkles: Vision Statement
For new student members on the CSUN Esports club Discord server who need help navigating the server and answering common questions, our “MattyBot” is a Discord bot that will aid incoming student members in answering their specific questions related to campus life and CSUN Esports, unlike a general help bot our bot is fully customizable to fit the needs of the CSUN Esports server and CSUN gaming community.
